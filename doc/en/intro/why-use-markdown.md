# Why Use Markdown?

When you can set text formatting by clicking buttons in an interface, why bother writing in Markdown? Here are the reasons to use Markdown instead of Word-like editors:

## Improve Writing Efficiency

No need to frequently use the mouse for formatting, allowing you to maintain your train of thought. Writers can focus on content creation without being distracted by formatting issues.

Compared to traditional WYSIWYG editors, Markdown enables you to:
- Keep both hands on the keyboard for higher input efficiency
- Quickly format with simple markup symbols
- Avoid complex menu operations and formatting settings

## Lower Learning Curve

Compared to markup languages like LaTeX and HTML, Markdown syntax is extremely simple—most people can master the basics in under an hour.

Common markup symbols are fewer than ten:
- `#` for headings
- `*` for emphasis or lists
- `[]()` for links
- `![]()` for images

## Broad Compatibility

Almost all modern text editors, code editors, and note-taking apps support Markdown. From simple notepads to professional IDEs, you can find Markdown everywhere.

### Mainstream Platform Support

- **Code hosting platforms**: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Coding, Gitee
- **Writing platforms**: Jianshu, Zhihu, CSDN, Juejin, V2EX
- **Note-taking apps**: Notion, Obsidian, Typora, Youdao Note
- **Blog platforms**: Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, VuePress

## Version Control Friendly

As a plain text format, Markdown files work well with version control systems like Git, making it easy to:
- Track document revision history
- Collaborate and share documents in teams
- Compare differences between versions
- Manage branches and merges

This is in sharp contrast to word processors like Microsoft Word, which lock your content in proprietary file formats.

## Future-Proof

Even if a particular software or platform disappears, Markdown files, as plain text, can still be accessed and edited, ensuring long-term availability of your content.

### Platform Independence
- You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system
- Not limited by specific software versions
- Easy to migrate and back up

### Format Durability
This is an important consideration for books, academic papers, and other documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

## Wide Range of Application Scenarios

### Technical Documentation
- **API docs**: Clear heading hierarchy and code block display
- **Project guides**: From installation instructions to user manuals
- **Development standards**: Team coding standards and design guidelines

### Blogging
- **Content management**: Focus on content creation without worrying about complex HTML coding
- **Platform migration**: Articles can be easily migrated between platforms
- **Offline writing**: Write offline in any text editor

### Academic Writing
- **Paper drafts**: Structured document organization
- **Research notes**: Support for math formulas and citations
- **Collaborative writing**: Multi-person collaboration and version control

### Daily Notes
- **Meeting minutes**: Clear heading structure and list formatting
- **Study notes**: Support for code highlighting, charts, and more
- **Task management**: Use task list features
